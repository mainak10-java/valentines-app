          I have something special to tell you...  
          From the moment you came into my life, everything started feeling a little brighter, a little softer, and a lot more meaningful.

You make ordinary days feel special, and special days feel unforgettable. Your smile, your laughter, the way you care — it all stays with me longer than you probably realize.

I don’t just like being around you… I feel at home with you.

So this Valentine’s Day, I just want to say:
I choose you.
In the little moments, the big dreams, the chaos, the calm — I choose you in all of it.

Thank you for being you, for being real, and for being mine. ❤️
